  abstract  = "Abstract The first Provenance Challenge was set up in order to
               provide a forum for the community to understand the capabilities
               of different provenance systems and the expressiveness of their
               provenance representations. To this end, a functional magnetic
               resonance imaging workflow was defined, which participants had
               to either simulate or run in order to produce some provenance
               representation, from which a set of identified queries had to be
               implemented and executed. Sixteen teams responded to the
               challenge, and submitted their inputs. In this paper, we present
               the challenge workflow and queries, and summarize the
               participants' contributions. Copyright ? 2007 John Wiley \&
