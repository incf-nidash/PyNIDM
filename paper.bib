              critically important meta-data that is necessary for making use
              of the combined, available neuroimaging data. In this manuscript,
              we present work from the Derived Data Working Group, an
              open-access group sponsored by the Biomedical Informatics
              Research Network (BIRN) and the International Neuroimaging
              Coordinating Facility (INCF) focused on practical tools for
              distributed access to neuroimaging data. The working group
              develops models and tools facilitating the structured interchange
              of neuroimaging meta-data and is making progress towards a
              unified set of tools for such data and meta-data exchange. We
              report on the key components required for integrated access to
              raw and derived neuroimaging data as well as associated meta-data
              and provenance across neuroimaging resources. The components
              include (1) a structured terminology that provides semantic
              context to data, (2) a formal data model for neuroimaging with
              robust tracking of data provenance, (3) a web service-based
              application programming interface (API) that provides a
              consistent mechanism to access and query the data model, and (4)
              a provenance library that can be used for the extraction of
              provenance data by image analysts and imaging software
              developers. We believe that the framework and set of tools

              these obstacles requires large-scale multidisciplinary efforts.
              Although the field of genetics has pioneered data sharing for

              grassroots consortium aggregating and openly sharing 1112
              existing resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging
              (R-fMRI) data sets with corresponding structural MRI and
              phenotypic information from 539 individuals with ASDs and 573

              present this resource and demonstrate its suitability for
              advancing knowledge of ASD neurobiology based on analyses of 360
              male subjects with ASDs and 403 male age-matched TCs. We focused
              on whole-brain intrinsic functional connectivity and also survey
              a range of voxel-wise measures of intrinsic functional brain
              architecture. Whole-brain analyses reconciled seemingly disparate
              themes of both hypo- and hyperconnectivity in the ASD literature;
              both were detected, although hypoconnectivity dominated,
              particularly for corticocortical and interhemispheric functional
              connectivity. Exploratory analyses using an array of regional
              metrics of intrinsic brain function converged on common loci of
              dysfunction in ASDs (mid- and posterior insula and posterior
              cingulate cortex), and highlighted less commonly explored regions
              such as the thalamus. The survey of the ABIDE R-fMRI data sets
              provides unprecedented demonstrations of both replication and
              novel discovery. By pooling multiple international data sets,
              ABIDE is expected to accelerate the pace of discovery setting the
              stage for the next generation of ASD studies.",
